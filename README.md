This repository contains the PyTorch and TorchVision versions compatible with RISC-V, as well as other workloads used within the project's framework.
The requirements.txt file contains the list of requirements to create a python virtual environment compatible with both versions of vision and pytorch.

The workloads direcotry contains currently a testing framework "autograd" as well as vgg.py (impelemntation of the VGG19 neural network). We are undergoing testing of ResNet50 as well as GoogleNet, which will be uploaded in the following months.
