# VGG19 â€“ PyTorch (Modified)

This directory is a **modified version** of [VGG-PyTorch](https://github.com/ZhiqiangZhangCUG/VGG-PyTorch),  

## Additions in This Fork

- `load_pretrained_vgg11.py`: downloads and saves a pretrained model to `results/pretrained_models/`.
- `train_distributed.py`: mechanism to train the model across multiple nodes.
- `train_distributed_debug.py`: distributed training with detailed debug statements.

All other scripts (training, testing, dataset preparation) remain compatible with the original repository.
